# Jack-Syntax-Analyzer
Develop a syntax analyzer for the Jack programming language that parses Jack programs and generates corresponding XML files. These XML files reflect the program's structure according to the Jack grammar, laying the groundwork for the next project, which will involve generating VM code from these structures.
